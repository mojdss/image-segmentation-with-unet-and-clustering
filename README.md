# image-segmentation-with-unet-and-clustering
This project focuses on combining **deep learning-based image segmentation using U-Net** with **clustering techniques** to enhance the understanding and categorization of segmented regions in images. The main idea is to not only segment the input image into meaningful parts but also group similar segments together based on their features
