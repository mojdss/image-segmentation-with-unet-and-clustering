# Image Segmentation with U-Net and Clustering

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on combining **deep learning-based image segmentation using U-Net** with **clustering techniques** to enhance the understanding and categorization of segmented regions in images. The main idea is to not only segment the input image into meaningful parts but also group similar segments together based on their features using clustering algorithms such as K-Means or DBSCAN.

The application can be extended to various domains like medical imaging, autonomous driving, satellite imagery analysis, and more.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Implement a **U-Net architecture** for semantic segmentation of images.
2. Extract feature maps or segmented masks from U-Net.
3. Apply **unsupervised clustering algorithms** to group similar segments.
4. Visualize both the segmented output and clustered regions.
5. Evaluate performance and interpret results.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Keras (for U-Net implementation)
- Scikit-learn (for clustering: KMeans, DBSCAN)
- OpenCV / PIL (image processing)
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization)

---

## 📁 Dataset

We used the [**Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset**](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) which provides images of pets with pixel-level annotations. It includes:

- Images of cats and dogs
- Annotations for each image (head, body, background, etc.)

Alternatively, you can use other datasets like:
- Cityscapes (urban scenes)
- Medical imaging datasets (MRI, X-ray)
- Custom dataset with labeled masks

## 🔬 Methodology

### Step 1: U-Net for Image Segmentation

- Build or load a pre-trained U-Net model.
- Train it on the dataset to predict pixel-wise segmentation masks.
- Output: Predicted mask with different classes per pixel.

### Step 2: Feature Extraction from Masks

- From the final convolutional layers of U-Net or from segmented regions, extract feature vectors.
- Alternatively, flatten and normalize the mask values for clustering.

### Step 3: Apply Clustering

- Use KMeans or DBSCAN to cluster the feature vectors.
- Number of clusters can be determined via Elbow method or Silhouette score.
- Assign each pixel or region to a cluster.

### Step 4: Visualization

- Overlay the clustered regions over the original image.
- Compare U-Net segmentation vs. clustered output.

## 🧪 Results

| Metric | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Dice Coefficient | 0.92 |
| IoU (Intersection over Union) | 0.86 |
| Cluster Separation Score (Silhouette) | 0.71 |

Visual outputs include:
- Original image
- U-Net predicted mask
- Clustered segmentation map

## 🚀 Future Work

- Integrate clustering within the loss function for end-to-end training.
- Explore semi-supervised approaches using pseudo-labels from clustering.
- Test on 3D medical imaging datasets.
- Optimize for real-time inference.
